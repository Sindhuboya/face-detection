Face detection involves identifying a person’s face in an image or video. This is done by analyzing the visual input to determine whether a person’s facial features are present.

Since human faces are so diverse, face detection models typically need to be trained on large amounts of input data for them to be accurate. The training dataset must contain a sufficient representation of people who come from different backgrounds, genders, and cultures.

he idea behind this technique involves using a cascade of classifiers to detect different features in an image. These classifiers are then combined into one strong classifier that can accurately distinguish between samples that contain a human face from those that don’t.

The Haar Cascade classifier that is built into OpenCV has already been trained on a large dataset of human faces, so no further training is required. We just need to load the classifier from the library and use it to perform face detection on an input image.
